Let's Connect is the only platform where you can find all Hackathon Hosting Platforms and Events such as Upcoming Seminars and Webinars at one place.

# Why we built Let's Connect website?

As an Indian Student, I just listened about "Hackathon" and "Events" words many years ago. When I properly knew about hackathons then I was struggling to find 
the platforms which are Hosting Hackathons and same way with events. In India many of my friends and students don't even know about Hackathons and when they know 
about it, then they struggle to find Hackathons. 

That's Why I built this platform for my friends, students and also for me so that every Student of India gain all information 
about recent or upcoming Hackathons or Events and connect with communities to enhance their skills and knowledge.
